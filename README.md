This repository contains the implementation of a **2D Dance Move Generation Model**. The model uses **OpenPose** for pose extraction and **Librosa** for audio analysis to generate 2D dance moves based on audio inputs. A simple **GUI interface** is provided for user interaction.

---

## Features

- Generate 2D dance moves from audio input files.
- Pre-trained model included for generating high-quality dance moves.
- Sample `.wav` files included to get started quickly.
- User-friendly GUI for interaction and visualization.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the GUI interface:

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:  
   ```bash
